# Main exercises

The following data will be used in the used for the exercises in this course. The data comes from a mock RNA sequencing data with 12 samples that are from cell-lines. As in any normal RNAseq analysis the counts of genes were normalized using different methods such as `VST` and `CPM` after filtering out the genes that were of very low expression. We would use these data for visulaizations. 

**Download all of these files into your current working directory**

You can download all the files together [here](data/data.zip).
Make a directory called `data` and `unzip` in that directory!

If `ggplot_geneco_course` is my current working directory, the directory tree should look like this:

* ggplot_geneco_course
  + data
    + archaea_nexus.txt
    + arch_newick.txt
    + counts_deseq2.txt
    + counts_filtered.txt
    + counts_raw.txt
    + counts_vst.txt
    + human_biomaRt_annotation.csv
    + metadata_raw.csv
    + Time_t24_vs_t0.txt
    + Time_t2_vs_t0.txt
    + Time_t6_vs_t0.txt
    + tree_env.tsv
    + tree_hmap.tsv


You can find the information related to the important files below:

## Counts table

* Table with gene counts after filtering: [Filtered Counts](data/counts_filtered.txt)
* Table with gene counts normalized with VST: [VST counts](data/counts_vst.txt)
* Table with gene counts normalized with DESeq2: [DESeq2 counts](data/counts_deseq2.txt)

## Metadata

* Metadata of the samples: [Sample Metadata](data/metadata_raw.csv)
* Metadata of the genes with their functions: [Gene Annotation](data/human_biomaRt_annotation.csv)
